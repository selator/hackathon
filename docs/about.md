I'm organising a vegan themed hackathon<sup>[\[?\]](https://hackathon.guide/)</sup> in Budapest that's going to happen on 18-19 May, 2019. This would be a two-day event, where participants will work on a project in small groups of 2-5 members, then demo their progress at the end. Also expect lots of vegan food, coffee and an afterparty.

You can participate as an organiser, a software developer, UX designer, graphic designer, system engineer, product manager, geographer or vegan know-it-all.

I'm also looking for animal rights or vegan advocacy organisations who have specific software needs, be it a website or a mobile app, so we will have project ideas for what to work on during the hackathon. Participants can also bring their own project ideas including websites, mobile apps, maps or other visualisations for animal use related data (e.g. emissions) or even educational games.

The project is in its very early stages, so I'm open to ideas on how to make it a successful event.
