I'm organising a vegan themed hackathon<sup>[\[?\]](https://hackathon.guide/)</sup> in Budapest, preferably in April-May of 2019. This would be a one or two-day event, where participants will work on a project in small groups, then demo their progress at the end. Also expect lots of vegan food, coffee and an afterparty.

You can participate as an organiser, a software developer, UX designer, graphic designer, system engineer, product manager, geographer or vegan know-it-all.

I'm also looking for animal rights or vegan advocacy organisations who have specific software needs, be it a website or a mobile app, so we will have project ideas for what to work on during the hackathon.

The project is in its very early stages, so I'm open to ideas on how to make it a successful event.
